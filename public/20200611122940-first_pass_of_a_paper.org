* Notes
[Most of this is  taken pretty much verbatim from the referenced paper.]

The goal of the first pass is to get an overview and decide whether any more
passes are needed. It should take 5-10 minutes.

1) Carefully read title, abstract and introduction
2) Read section and subsection headings, but ignore everything else
3) Read the conclusion
4) Glance over references, mentally checking off what you read before

As an output, after the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:

1. Category: What type of paper is this? Measurement, analysis, description of prototype?
2. Context: Which other papers does this relate to? What theoretical basis is used?
3. Correctness: Does assumptions appear valid?
4. Contributions: What's the main contribution?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

[Write this down.]
