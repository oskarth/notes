* Notes
Since nodes can come and join at an time, how many peers can breakdown and the
network still remain largely connected?

Cohen have showed that, when connectivity follows a power-law distribution,
specifically when:

\begin{equation}
\alpha \le 3
\end{equation}

The network is very robust to random breakdown. What do we mean by robust? A
connected cluster that spans the entire network survives.

There's a specific formula for this in the paper for the criterion.

For Gnutella, the observed power-law index is alpha = 2.3 and minimum node
degree is 1.

They claim the maximum node degree of 20 is roughly equal to what is seen in the
wild [though I can't find this in the paper].

[What I don't understand is, wouldn't 60% of hosts be offline quite often?]
