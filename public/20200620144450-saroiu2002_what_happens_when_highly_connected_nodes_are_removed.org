* Notes

This image shows how Gnutella topology looks, what happens when we remove nodes from it.

In the middle the largest connected component has 1106 out of 1300 nodes.
However, a motivated attacker wouldn't remove random peers, but would instead
remove them most connected nodes. Due to the power law distribution of
connectivity, this would have a big impact.

Removing only 63 highly connected peers leads to many disconnected components.
