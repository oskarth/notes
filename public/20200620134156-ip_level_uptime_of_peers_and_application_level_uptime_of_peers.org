How many peers are highly-available?

This image shows that Internet Hosts are online about the same for Gnutella and
Napster. However, when it comes to application uptime, we see that Napster Hosts
are online more often.

Only 20% of nodes have an Internet Host uptime of 90% or more.

This has implications for reasonable uptime assumptions for other P2P Desktop
applications.
